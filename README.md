####Omeka plugin to generate Chicago-style citations####

This simple plugin is based on some very helpful code and instructions provided on the Omeka forum by sheepeeh (http://omeka.org/forums/topic/change-citation-style)

The plugin will check the "Item Type" metadata element within Omeka's Zotero array, and (according to the Chicago Manual of Style rules pertaining to that item type) generate Chicago citations by pulling from the Zotero metadata associated with the Omeka item

Currently, this document will detect the following item types: Book, Book Section, Journal Article, Newspaper Article, Webpage, Thesis, Document

This plugin was originally created to serve the needs of New York University Libraries' "Jewish Peddler Project" (http://jewishpeddler.org)
